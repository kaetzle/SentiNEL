32:4	32:4			negative	Well, I started using Google Chrome, which is a little better, but it freezes too sometimes.
32:5	32:5			negative	This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update, so if you don't save your files and information, everything will be lost.
32:6	32:6			negative	Another issue I have with it is the battery.
32:7	32:7			negative	Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden.

383:5	383:5			negative	Laptops are usually used on the go, so why not give you a better battery?
372:1	372:1			negative	The processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing.

97:2	97:2			negative	They said it was a computer error on this type of computer.
97:3	97:3			negative	Also, I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot, and not even sitting on anything to make it hot.
97:4	97:4			negative	When the computer has been on for several minutes, it will occasionaly just go off by itself.
97:5	97:5			negative	Also, the battery does not last very long at all.
97:6	97:6			negative	I would recommend not buying this product.
97:7	97:7			negative	I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem.
97:8	97:8			negative	I am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with.

230:8	230:8			negative	I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble.
230:9	230:9			negative	I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.
230:10	230:10			neutral	I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty.
230:11	230:11			negative	I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT.
230:12	230:12			negative	I waited and waited and no laptop.
230:13	230:13			negative	Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.
230:14	230:14			negative	"I waited another month for approval and for them to ""BUILD"" me a new laptop."
230:17	230:17			negative	Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.
230:18	230:18			negative	HP didn't fix it.
230:19	230:19			negative	I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one.
130:1	130:1			negative	in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
130:1	130:1			negative	in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.

130:3	130:3			negative	returned it.
130:4	130:4			negative	5 months dead again.
130:5	130:5			negative	They say sorry out of warranty.
130:6	130:6			negative	Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.
130:7	130:7			negative	Now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine.
130:8	130:8			negative	They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything.
130:9	130:9			negative	Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.
130:9	130:9			negative	Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.

52:3	52:3			negative	I burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so I can place it there.
52:4	52:4			negative	I had to call Apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times.
52:9	52:9			negative	For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).
52:10	52:10			negative	Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby.
52:11	52:11			negative	The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.
235:1	235:1			neutral	I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.
235:2	235:2			negative	Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.
235:3	235:3			positive	So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message.
235:5	235:5			neutral	Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook.
235:6	235:6			positive	Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though.
49:1	49:1			negative	I custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the techie due to his accent.
49:4	49:4			negative	The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork.

60:2	60:2			negative	They went through asking me open up various components, taking battery out, hard disk apart, and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it.
60:3	60:3			neutral	They are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site.
60:4	60:4			negative	I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from!
89:0	89:0			positive	This computer had exactly the specifications I needed.

89:3	89:3			negative	When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed.
89:4	89:4			negative	The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid (I have tried both Motorola and HTC) plugged into the USB port.
89:5	89:5			negative	"Called tech support and got the usual Acer ""We don't support software but for $$$ we can help you"" I explained there was no software involved in booting."
89:6	89:6			negative	"No, tey don't even support their own bios and it ""could be a problem with the bios"" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!"
89:7	89:7			negative	Needless to say a PC that can't support a cell phone is less than useless!
92:0	92:0			negative	With today's company fighting over marketshare, its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone.

92:5	92:5			negative	But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!
92:6	92:6			negative	Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time.
92:7	92:7			negative	This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.
92:10	92:10			negative	The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
92:12	92:12			negative	I'm tired of the inept service.
92:13	92:13			negative	If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS!!!
